        "In this project, we will build a highly interactive and intelligent system that lets users 'talk' with any document. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatCompletion API, the semantic understanding of embeddings, we'll create an application that can understand and retrieve information from documents in a conversational manner. For demonstration purposes, I have included Finance Minister's 2025 Budget speech as the reference document and asking questions related to this document.\n",

        "2. **Conversational Interface**: Provide users with the ability to ask questions and receive answers as if they were talking to a human expert on the document's content.\n",
        "3. **Contextual Awareness**: Maintain the thread of conversation, taking into account previous interactions and the document's subject matter.\n",
        "4. **Scalable Document Handling**: Efficiently manage and query a large number of documents using Pinecone's vector database capabilities.\n",
        "5. **Integrate RAG**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) aims to improve prediction quality by using an external datastore at inference time to build a richer prompt that includes some combination of context, history, and recent/relevant knowledge.\n"
